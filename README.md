# ML-Salary_Prediction_Decision_Tree_Regression

I have created Machine Learning Model With Decison Tree Regressor for Salary Predictions.

In this I've used Python’s Famous libraries like [Numpy](https://numpy.org/), [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), and [Sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/) for Vizualization and  Model Development.

I've used [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) for coding!

Download the dataset from [here](https://github.com/Anuragtsl/ML-Salary_Prediction_Decision_Tree_Regression/blob/main/Position_Salaries.csv)!

# Project Objective

**Let’s assume the below table is what the HR team of a company uses to determine what salary to offer to a new employee.**

* For our project, let’s take an example that an employee has applied for the role of a Regional Manager and has already worked as a Regional Manager for 2 years. So based on the table above — he falls between level 6 and level 7 — Lets say he falls under level 6.5 and much more!

* We want to build a model to predict what salary we should offer this new employee.
